## Summary

HFT Tools is a Python toolkit for financial researchers. Its goal is to provide a common, open-source tool for market microstucture research using NASDAQ HistoricalView-ITCH data. HFT Tools provides a simple method for converting ITCH datasets into meaningful data.

## Installation
![alt text](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/hfttools.svg "pypi")

Using the Python package manager:

```
pip install hfttools
```

## Example Usage

To create a new HDF5 database from an ITCH data file `itch_010113`:

```
import hfttools as hft

hft.unpack('itch_010113.bin',
           ver=4.1,
           date='2013-01-01',
           fout='itch.hdf5'
           nlevels=10,
           names=['GOOG', 'AAPL'],
           method='hdf5')
```

This will create a file `itch.hdf5` containing message and order book data for Google and Apple.

## Tips

Create massive datasets quickly by running multiple jobs. All databases generated by HFT Tools support simultaneous read/write. 

## TODO:

(1) Add support for trading halts (global).
  - Process trading halts in System messages.
  - If halt occurs, then writing = False.
  - If resume occurs, then writing = True.
(2) Add support for trading halts (individual).
  - Process the trading halts in Stock-Action messages.
  - Keep a list of halted stocks.
  - If halt occurs, do not proceed past message completion.
  - An elegant way to deal with this is to remove the stock from the namelist
    when a halt occurs, and then append it back when it resumes.
(3) Write print statements to log file at fout location.
  - Make this an option (e.g. log=True).
