1. Need to install HDF5 for h5py package:

> brew install homebrew/science/hdf5

2. Need to install Postgres.app for psycopg2. Just download it from the website. (Also recommend Postico as a GUI 
for OS X users).

DISTRIBUTING TO PYPI

1. Install requirements:

> pip install setuptools 
> pip install twine

2. Build distribution (makes package/dist and package/package.egg):

> cd package
> python setup.py sdist

3. Build wheel (makes package/build)

> python setup.py bdist_wheel

4. Publish to PyPI

> twine register dist/package.whl
> twine upload dist/*

NOTE: To upload to PyPI youâ€™ll need: (1) to make an account, and (2) make a ~/.pypirc file that tells twine how to register and upload your packages.

NOTE: To upload to PyPI Testing site instead use the -r option with twine (the repository name will be specified in your .pypirc file, e.g. [pypitest]):

> twine register -r pypitest dist/package.whl
> twine upload -r pypitest dist/*
